# printf project

# Information
Write your own printf function.

# Code Style
Betty code style

# Requirements

  # General
      Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
      All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
      Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
      All your files should end with a new line
      A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
      Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
      You are not allowed to use global variables
      No more than 5 functions per file
      In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
      The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called holberton.h
      Don’t forget to push your header file
      All your header files should be include guarded
      Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
      
# More Info
 
 In this project we need to write a function that works similar to the original function printf in 'C', for to do this task first we start for understand the function and how printf does this function we make a very basic flowchart with the things that we believe that printf does, after that we started for writing all the functions that we use later and creating the header file with all the libraries and prototypes that we use in the program.
 
## How to test the "printf function"
- [Clone]("https://github.com/Miguel22247/printf") this repository
- mv the file main.c that it's in test folder to printf folder
- use <code>$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c</code> to compile it
- run with ./a.out (is the default output)
<br>

  ## Authorized functions and macros
- write (man 2 write)
- malloc (man 3 malloc)
- free (man 3 free)
- va_start (man 3 va_start)
- va_end (man 3 va_end)
- va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
- va_arg (man 3 va_arg)
<br>

# Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way:
<code>$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c</code>
